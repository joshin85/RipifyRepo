Ripify
A simple program designed to take a certain programs list of web addresses and download them from youtube.
Simply select all the files press ctrl + c and paste them into a text file.  Compile the .java file (you need to include some java libraries.)
open the jar and provide it the path to the text file. I would suggest that you open the program in an empty folder.
